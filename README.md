### Description
***
Des/Via is a web application that addresses the issue of tourism in Barcelona and proposes a solution to decongest popular tourist sites while attracting visitors to areas with lower tourist activity. The proposal involves displaying information about the state of tourism in the city and presenting cultural points of interest on an interactive map, which are located in zones with low tourist intensity.
The information about the cultural points of interest is obtained from an Open Data CSV file and is correlated with a tourist intensity heat map of Barcelona, generated from a GPKG file of coordinates also extracted from Open Data. The points of interest are classified into five categories, where category 1 represents those located in zones with low tourist intensity, and category 5 corresponds to those with higher intensity.
